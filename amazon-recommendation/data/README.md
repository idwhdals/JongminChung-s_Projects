## Data Files

Due to the large size of the datasets, they cannot be uploaded directly to this GitHub repository. Instead, the files are hosted externally and can be downloaded using the links below:

1. **[Books_rating.csv.zip (1.08GB)](https://drive.google.com/your-file-link)**  
   - This file contains user ratings for books, including user IDs, book IDs, and rating values.  
   - *Note: The file is compressed as `.zip` due to its large size. Please unzip it before use.*

2. **[books_data.csv.zip](https://drive.google.com/your-file-link)**  
   - This file contains metadata about books, such as titles, authors, genres, and publication details.  
   - *Note: Like the ratings file, this dataset is also compressed as `.zip` due to its size.*
